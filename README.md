## Test task

### Description

We have collected chat statistics for each day by a unique website Id.
The file contains stats collected over 14 days.
Each entry contains:

- Website Id
- Date
- Total number of chats
- Total number of missed chats

There will only be one entry for a website per day.
For example, if there are a total of 5 websites for a period of 14 days, there will be 70 entries in the
file.

### Task

Write a program that will fetch the statistics from the URL which outputs the sum of chats and
missed chats per website Id for a given date range.If the date range is not provided, the sum should be calculated for the entire data set.

### Examples output

```processStatistics()

}, {
websiteId: '4f8b36d00000000000222222',
